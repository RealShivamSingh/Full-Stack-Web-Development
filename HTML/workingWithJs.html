    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Spider-Man</b>is a superhero appearing in American comic books
      published by

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man">Marvel Comics</a>.
      Created by writer-editor <b>Stan Lee </b>and artist Steve Ditko, he first
      appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in
      the Silver Age of Comic Books.

      In The Creation of Spider-Man, <a href="#">comic book</a> writer-editor and historian Paul
      Kupperberg calls the character's superpowers "nothing too original"; what
      was original was that outside his secret identity, he was a "nerdy high
      school student". Going against typical superhero fare, Spider-Man
      included "heavy doses of soap-opera and elements of melodrama". Kupperberg
      feels that Lee and Ditko had created something new in the world of comics:
      "the flawed superhero with everyday problems".
